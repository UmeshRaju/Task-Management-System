# Task Management System

Introduction
This is a Task Management System designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It features a modern front-end built with React and a robust back-end powered by Spring Boot. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. All changes are persisted on the backend to ensure data consistency.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can create and add tasks.
Mark as Completed: Users can check off tasks once they’re done.
Delete Tasks: Unnecessary tasks can be deleted.
Persistent Data: Task data is stored and managed in the Spring Boot backend.
Interactive UI: A dynamic and responsive front-end built with React.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React
Axios (for API requests)
HTML5, CSS3
Backend:

Spring Boot
RESTful APIs
Database:

H2 Database (or any other configured RDBMS)
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
Maven installed (optional)
Database (H2 included by default)
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-backend.git  
Navigate to the Backend Directory

bash
Copy code
cd task-management-backend  
Run the Application

Use Maven to build and run the project:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run  
The backend will start on http://localhost:8080.
Database Configuration

By default, H2 Database is used. You can change the database configuration in application.properties:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:taskdb  
spring.datasource.username=sa  
spring.datasource.password=  
Frontend Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-frontend.git  
Navigate to the Frontend Directory

bash
Copy code
cd task-management-frontend  
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install  
Run the Application

bash
Copy code
npm start  
The front-end will start on http://localhost:3000.
Usage
Add Task

Mark as Completed
Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as done.

Delete Task
Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.

Persistent Data
All operations reflect in the backend and are stored in the database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
